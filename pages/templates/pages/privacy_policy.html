We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

                                                        DATA SECURITY
                                                        We take appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is kept secure, including security measures to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an unauthorized way. We limit access to your personal data to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
                                                        We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.
                                                        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Sites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.

When we determine that your personal data is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected, we will securely delete or anonymize your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policies.

                                                        These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Agreement") are an agreement between ERMINE NIG. LTD. ("ERMINE, the Company", "us", "we" or "our") and you ("User", "you" or "your").
                                                        We are a company duly registered and licensed. This Agreement including our Privacy Policy sets forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the ERMINE Websites, Web applications, and Mobile applications, a product of the Company, or such name or product communicated by ERMINE from time to time, including all features and functionality, the site, content, application, user interface and software associated with our service and any of its products or services (collectively, "Platform" or "Services").
                                                        By using the Platform, you are entering into a binding contract with the Company. Your agreement with us includes these Terms and our Privacy Policy (the "Agreements").
                                                        1.1 ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS OF USE
                                                        By accessing, visiting, or using the Platform, via this site or any other device or application or other technology, you accept and agree to be bound by the Terms. Please read carefully. Further, you shall be subject to any additional terms of use that apply when you use certain products or posted guidelines or rules applicable to our Services, which may be posted and modified from time to time. All such guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms.
                                                        ANY ACCESS, USE, or PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICES WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES OR ANY OF OUR PLATFORM OR ACCESS OUR SERVICES.
                                                        2. ACCOUNTS
                                                        You must be registered with an account on the websites to be able to use the Platform. Our Services can be accessed on a computer, laptop device, and/or mobile device running an operating system supported by us. To log onto the Platform, you will need to enter your User ID and other security information that we request, or when available, by using biometric authentication which is a security process that relies on your unique biological characteristics so as to verify your identity. The current supported biometric authentication methods are touch ID and face ID methods.
                                                        You understand that when using the biometric authentication to log onto the Platform, any fingerprint, facial map, or any other biometric data stored on your mobile device can be used to access the Platform and your accounts and to give instructions for certain transactions. You, therefore, should ensure that your mobile device only stores your own fingerprint(s), facial map, or other biometric data, and will not store anyone else’s biometric credentials (e.g., fingerprint, facial map, or any other biometric data).
                                                        The biometric authentication on the Platform is performed by the biometric authentication module of your device, and we do not control the functionality of any mode of biometric authentication including fingerprint, touch ID, or face ID. We make no representation or warranty as to the security of the biometric authentication function on your mobile device and we do not have access to your fingerprint(s) or facial recognition information. For more information on how the biometric functionality works for your mobile device, please refer to your device manufacturer’s support resources.
                                                        You understand and agree that any fingerprint stored on your mobile device can be used to access your account with ERMINE, therefore you shall take all reasonable measures to keep your mobile device and the password used to register your fingerprint(s), facial map, or other biometric data on your mobile device in your safe custody, and to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of your mobile device and the password. You shall be fully responsible for and bear the risk of any accidental or unauthorized disclosure of your mobile device and password to any other person or any unauthorized use of your mobile device and password by any other person.
                                                        We may notify you from time to time about changes in the security information. We will automatically log you out of the Platform if you are inactive for 4 minutes.
                                                        If you register an account via the Platform, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.
                                                        3. THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS
                                                        We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services ("Service Providers"), to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform certain services or to assist us in analysing how our Services are used.
                                                        These third parties have access to your Personal Data (as defined in the Privacy Policy) only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
                                                        4. QUALIFICATION FOR USE
                                                        Accounts are available only to people aged 18 or over. You must be over the age of 18 to operate an account with the Company and use the Platform. Individuals under the age of 18 may utilize the service only with the involvement of a parent or legal guardian, under such person’s account and otherwise subject to these Terms. The User must have the contractual capacity to enter a binding contract with us and must not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws.
